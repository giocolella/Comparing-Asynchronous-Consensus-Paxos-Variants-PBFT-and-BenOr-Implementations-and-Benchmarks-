# Comparing-Asynchronous-Consensus-Paxos-Variants-PBFT-and-BenOr-Implementations-and-Benchmarks-
The goal of this project is to compare the different approaches to obtaining consensus in asynchronous systems with different difficulties: crash faults, silent node, byzantine nodes and network unreliability. The protocols are implemented, benchmarked and compared.
